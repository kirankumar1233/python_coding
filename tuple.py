# tuple it is similar to list but immutable i.e elements in list cannot be changed
# syntax kiran=()
# it also supports index and string so it also supports slicing
# tuple has no seperate functions but it works for some built in functions like min max sum len etc

print(len(kiran))
print(min(kiran))
print(max(kiran))
